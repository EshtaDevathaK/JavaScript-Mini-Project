<!-- 
Basic Testing (Simple Unit Tests)
✅ GOAL
Write a set of basic unit tests (without using Jest) to verify simple utility functions—sum and isEven. Understand how to structure tests, check expected vs. actual, and report pass/fail.

🎯 BEHAVIOR

| Test                  | Expected Outcome                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `sum(2, 3) === 5`     | Test passes, log “PASS: sum(2,3) == 5”         |
| `sum(-1, 1) === 0`    | Test passes                                    |
| `isEven(4) === true`  | Test passes                                    |
| `isEven(3) === false` | Test passes                                    |
| Any other combination | On failure, log “FAIL: … expected … but got …” |

<!-- 
🧪 Try It
Open index.html in the browser.

Press F12 (DevTools) → check the Console. You should see:

✅ PASS: sum(2, 3) should be 5
✅ PASS: sum(-1, 1) should be 0
✅ PASS: isEven(4) should return true
✅ PASS: isEven(3) should return false
Uncomment the intentionally failing test at the bottom of test.js. Refresh → see a “FAIL” with details. This shows how a failing assertion is reported.
