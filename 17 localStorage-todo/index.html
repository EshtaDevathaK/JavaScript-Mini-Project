7. LocalStorage / SessionStorage
✅ GOAL
Create a simple to-do form where items are saved in localStorage so that, on page reload, previously saved to-dos reappear. Learn how to store, retrieve, and remove data from localStorage.

🎯 BEHAVIOR

| Action                    | Behavior                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Submit a new to-do        | Item appended to list and stored in `localStorage`         |
| Reload page               | Previously saved to-dos load from `localStorage`           |
| Click "Remove" on an item | That item is removed from both the list and `localStorage` |

  <h2>To-Do List (Persists with localStorage)</h2>
  
  <form id="todoForm">
    <input type="text" id="todoInput" placeholder="Enter a task" required />
    <button type="submit">Add</button>
  </form>

  <ul id="todoList"></ul>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- 

🧪 Try It
Open index.html in your browser.

Enter a task (e.g., “Buy groceries”) and click Add—item appears in the list.

Refresh the page—task remains (loaded from localStorage).

Click Remove next to an item—item disappears and is removed from localStorage.

Refresh again—item is gone permanently. -->
