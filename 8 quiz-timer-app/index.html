Perfect! Here's Task 8/10 ‚Äî a simple yet interactive Quiz App with a timer and score calculation, designed to match your fresher-level comfort with intermediate-level behaviors.

‚úÖ GOAL: 
Build a Quiz App that:

Shows one question at a time (MCQ)

Includes a countdown timer per question

Tracks correct answers and displays final score

Moves automatically to the next question after timer ends or user answers

No backend needed ‚Äî all client-side

üéØ BEHAVIOR:

| Feature             | Behavior                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Questions & options | Display one question at a time with 4 choices |
| Timer (10s each)    | Automatically moves to next if time runs out  |
| Score tracking      | +1 for each correct answer                    |
| Final screen        | Shows score and "Try Again" option            |
