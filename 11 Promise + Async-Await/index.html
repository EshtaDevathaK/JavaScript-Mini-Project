<!-- 
Below are 10 intermediate-level JavaScript mini-tasks, each presented with a clear Goal, Behavior, File Structure, Code, and “Try It” instructions—designed for a fresher progressing to intermediate. Feel free to copy each into VS Code, run them, and tweak as you learn.

1. Promises + Async/Await
✅ GOAL
Demonstrate fetching data from a public API using both Promise chaining (.then()/.catch()) and async/await. See how error handling differs and why async/await often leads to cleaner code.

🎯 BEHAVIOR    

| Action                               | Behavior                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Call function using Promise chaining | Fetches JSON, logs data or logs any network/error            |
| Call function using `async`/`await`  | Fetches JSON, logs data or handles errors inside `try/catch` |
| Invalid URL or network failure       | Error message displayed in `catch` block (both approaches)   |

<!-- 
🧪 Try It
Open index.html in the browser.

Click “Fetch with .then()” and watch the post JSON appear or an error if the network is down.

Click “Fetch with async/await”—observe the same data but handled inside a try/catch.

Temporarily change API_URL to an invalid URL (e.g., .../invalid) and re-click each button to see how errors are caught differently.
