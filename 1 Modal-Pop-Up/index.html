<!-- 
Here’s Task 1/10 – a clean, intermediate-level reusable modal popup component in JavaScript using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).

✅ Features:
Reusable modal

Open/close on button click

Close on clicking outside (overlay)

ESC key closes the modal -->


  <button id="openModalBtn">Open Modal</button>

  <!-- Reusable Modal Structure -->
  <div id="modal" class="modal hidden">  <!-- BackGround & Box as a Whole -->
    <div class="modal-overlay"></div>  <!-- BackGround Separate given because , in Js we wrote [ display: none ] on overlay clicks [ BG Clicks ]=>  overlay.addEventListener('click', closeModal); -->
    <div class="modal-content">  <!-- Model-Box Separate , one after another for a reason, not to Overlap  -->
      <span class="close-btn">&times;</span>
      <h2>Hello from Modal!</h2>
      <p>This is a reusable modal popup component.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script src="modal.js"></script>
   
</body>
</html>

| Element    | Default Behavior             | Notes                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------  |
| `<button>` | Clickable, styled by default | Overkill for a simple icon, needs resets             |
| `<div>`    | Block element, full width    | Needs extra CSS to shrink it down                    |
| `<span>`   | Inline element, minimal      | Lightweight, easy to style for a small close icon    | -->


<!-- 
  2️⃣ Second Snippet:
The overlay <div> is a sibling to the .modal-content div.
Result:

The overlay can be targeted separately from the modal content.

Clicking on the overlay div doesn’t overlap with the modal content—so you can specifically listen for overlay clicks to close the modal. -->



<!-- 🔍 The Core Idea
In your modal, there are two main pieces:
1️⃣ The overlay (the dark background)
2️⃣ The modal box (the white content in the center)

Visually, they look the same whether:

The modal box is inside the overlay

Or the overlay and modal box are side-by-side. -->



<!-- 
🖼️ VISUAL DEMO (Think Like a Box)
✅ Imagine you have a big box (modal)

Inside that big box you put:

a semi-transparent sheet (overlay)

and the modal box with your text (modal-content).

Now, depending on how you put those boxes, it matters for event handling.
